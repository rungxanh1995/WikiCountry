## Context & Disclaimer
WikiCountry was initially coded in correspondence to Paul Hudson’s "100 Days Of Swift" challenge, [day 59](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/59).

However, as I was able to expand WikiCountry much beyond the [course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/)’s original scope, I enjoy using WikiCountry so much for being a geography fanatic, and I’d love to offer it as a gift to like-minded Apple users out there, I have decided to publish it to the App Store.

Please do your due diligence with the info provided by WikiCountry before citing any in your professional work :)
